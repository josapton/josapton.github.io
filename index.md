I am a student and lazy programmer who thrives on balancing productivity with relaxation. While I have a laid back demeanor, I’m committed to honing my skills and making meaningful contributions in the tech world.

### Academic and Technical Pursuits

Currently, I’m diving into the worlds of DevOps, AI engineering, and data science. Each domain offers unique challenges automation pipelines in DevOps, model training in AI, and statistical insights in data science and I’m eager to master them all.

**DevOps engineering**: learning CI/CD, containerization, and infrastructure as code

**AI engineering**: exploring neural networks, model deployment, and ethics

**Data science**: practicing data wrangling, visualization, and predictive analytics

### Hobbies and Passions

When I’m not buried in tutorials or debugging scripts, I recharge by playing rhythm and strategy games. Gaming fuels my creativity and keeps my problem solving skills sharp.

### Personality and Work Style

I embrace a relaxed approach to coding sometimes that means procrastinating, but it also means I know how to work smart when deadlines loom. Curiosity drives me, and I enjoy tackling new tools and methodologies at my own pace.

### Looking Ahead

My goal is to transition from lazy student to professional, securing a role where I can blend DevOps automation, AI innovation, and data driven decision making. With continued practice, a bit of caffeine, and a steady stream of game breaks, I’m confident I’ll get there **:)**
